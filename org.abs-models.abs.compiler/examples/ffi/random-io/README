This is a small example that demonstrates the use of the FFI (a.k.a. FLI).
It uses java.util.Random to generate a random number and prints it to standard output.

Use "make gen" to generate code and "make run" to run it and see the output.

The Makefile assumes that it can find Tools/ABS/trunk/frontend/dist/absfrontend.jar.
You might need to build it first ("ant dist").

Note that at some point in the future "fli" will be replaced with "ffi".
